# PTC-SLiM
SLiM scripts for simulating PTC evolution in cavefish

PTC_neutral_model.txt --> Simulates 175k generations in a cavefish population (Ne = 32,000). Both de novo PTCs and those sourced from standing genetic variation (seeded into the population at the beginning of the model) have a fixed distribution of fitness effects at 0 (neither have any fitness effect).
